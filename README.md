Day 1340032: 1/8/2022
-FINALLY completed the project, it is nice to have a certificate as proof of what I have been learnign, even if it is generally worthless
-I have a few take aways:
. I am so much more comfortable writing and switching between CSS and HTML. I used to get confused between the two and now I can easily go back and forth as needed. 
. I am now understanding the limitations of tutorials such as FCC, and others. Tutorials make it easy, but only writing code makes you learn. I think I am going to go a different route for the remainder of my learning journey.
